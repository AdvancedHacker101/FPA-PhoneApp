# Contribution GuideLines
**Thank you** for considering contribution to this project.  
I belive this project is a good concept and really can change the way we authenticate with services!
## Method of contibution
There are 2 main ways to contribute:  
### Forking (1)
So if you have a plan, and you want to do things you can:
1. Fork the project and make your changes  
2. Issue a pull request and get your changes reviewed
3. Your changes get pulled into the project!

It's simple as this, the review is important, but don't be shy to contibute because of it. This is just to make sure that the project is working together with your changes.  

### Creating issues (2)
Even if it's just a question, a suggestion open a new issue about it.  
Thanks to the labels github provides, I can differentiate between bugs and questions/suggestions!  
When opening an issue please check out other open issues, maybe your question has been posted before!  
If you do write a new issue, please be sure that:
1. I can understand what you wrote (I can read english and that's it)
2. You provide enough information when posting about a problem/possible bug
3. You provide enough details about a new feature when posting a suggestion

Just keep in mind these **3 points** and contributing will be a better experience for everybody!

## Type and Priority of contribution
### Label Priority
* Bugs and Fixes are the \#1 Priority for me
* Supporting a new android OS is the next in the priority list.
* Questions come next, however I may answer an easy question before fixing a bug
* Suggestions/New features are the last, because I want to make sure the program works before putting more on top of it!
### Type priority
* Security issues are \#1, because this project is working with credentials
* General bugs
* New android OS support
* Power and Network effieciency
* Optimization code
* User experience
* User interface
### Types of required contributions
This paragraph is subject to change as time goes on.
* Security People, as I wrote I need to make sure the security of this application is as strong as it can be.  
  * Ask any security related questions, and I'll be more than happy to answer them.  
  * Make a suggestion, I'm open to reworking the current code, if it can get more secure by doing so.  
  * It's optional but please provide an example on how to re-create a potential security vulnerability.
* Android Developers, because **100%** of the code is written in Java/Android  
  * You can give anything from security fixes, to code optimization.  
  * I'm also happy if you can point out some edge-cases I didn't notice
  * You can also implement new android OS features to the project (just keep in mind backward compatibility)
  * Even if the code is very event based, and not constantly running in the background, Network and Power optimizations are welcome.
* Java developers, because android is based on jave
  * This goes close with the android devs but android devs are more focused on android features I think
  * This group can implement new java language features in the project
  * This group isn't working with android itself, but this group too should think about the efficiency (Network & Power) of the application
* People knowing >1 languages, because I think this is a good project for everyone to use.
  * You have to translate the messages the user actually sees from the output. This doesn't include debugging messages written to logcat.
  * I belive this project can get big so I want to support more languages than just english.
* User experience people, because I want this to be beautiful to look at and easy to use  
  * Point out design issues, think of how people can use this easier.
  * This group needs work together with the language group in case of RTL languages
  * Android takes care of RTL languages, just make sure it doesn't do something wrong
* User Interface Designers, because I want this project to look good!  
  * This goes close with the UX people, but that group is more of the thinker side of the things I think.  
  * In this group you can take suggestions from the UX group and **implement** them in the code.  
  * If you have a logo design open an issue ASAP!
* Testers, because we need to make sure the app actually works  
  * This is the last group, here you need to test the application, from A-Z.  
  * Think of edge cases and try them out.  
  * If an error message if ugly you can work with the UX and UI groups.
  * If an edge case isn't handled properly you can work with the Java dev or Android dev group
* People with Google Play Store experience, because this project may get big
  * This is a really far goal, but we might need to add this application to the play store for regular users
  * For now you should just note, this project might need some support of this kind in the far future :)
  
If you didn't fall in any of the categories, then don't worry. These are just guidelines, about what the project requires. Maybe I forgot a topic?  
Ignore this list than and go for opening an issue! Remember that all of the issues are welcome!
